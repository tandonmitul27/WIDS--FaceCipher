# WIDS--FaceCipher
This project is focused on exploring and implementing various techniques in image processing, object detection, and facial recognition. Over the course of four weeks, the project leverages different models and frameworks to develop a robust system for facial recognition and analysis.
1. [WEEK 1](WEEK1) : Python Modules - Linear and Logistic Regression
2. [WEEK 2](WEEK2) : TensorFlow/PyTorch - Neural Networks and YOLOv8
3. [WEEK 3]() : OpenCV and CNN for Image Processing
4. [WEEK 4]() : Siamese Neural Networks - Face Recognition


To ensure timely completion of assignments, it is crucial to start each week as early as possible.
